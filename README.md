# RH-TW-sandbox
This is a place for writers to practice things like rebase and stash and other fun(?) git commands.

We can define a few basic tasks to practice, and then take notes on each task, and refine thise notes as we practice the task. 

So go ahead and fork, then clone, this repo and start working in your forked version. The add/commit/push up to this upstream repo, and create a PR so that your changes are mreged into this upstream repo.

And, have fun and don't worry; it doesn;t matter at all if things go horribly awry anywhere in this repo; we can fix it if it does. So be brave, be fearless, and experiment!
